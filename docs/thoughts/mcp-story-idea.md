- **Plot Thread Management**: Track, develop, and resolve story threads across episodes  
- **Character Arc Integration**: Ensure character development aligns with story progression
- **Genre Intelligence**: Apply genre-specific storytelling rules and patterns
- **Pacing Analysis**: Optimize story pacing and tension curves
- **Consistency Validation**: Check for plot holes, timeline issues, character contradictions

})
# Returns: thread lifecycle, resolution points, interconnections
```

#### **3. Narrative Consistency Checking**
**Function**: Detect plot holes and continuity issues
```python
# Conceptual interface  
consistency_check = await story_mcp.validate_consistency({
    "story_elements": [...],
    "character_arcs": [...],
    "timeline": [...]
})
# Returns: potential issues, severity scores, suggested fixes
```

#### **4. Genre Pattern Application**
**Function**: Apply genre-specific storytelling conventions
```python
# Conceptual interface
genre_guidance = await story_mcp.apply_genre_patterns({
    "genre": "noir_thriller", 
    "story_beats": [...],
    "character_types": [...]
})
# Returns: genre-specific improvements, convention compliance, authenticity score
