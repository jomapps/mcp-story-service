# Feature Specification: MCP Story Service - Standalone Narrative Intelligence Server

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-have-put`  
**Created**: 2025-09-26  
**Status**: Ready for Planning  
**Input**: User description: "I have put app idea in D:\Projects\mcp-story-service\ this is a standalone mcp server meant to work with the whole system of apps as described in docs\thoughts\Domain-configs.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Standalone MCP server for narrative intelligence within larger AI movie platform
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: AI agents, content creators, story developers
   ‚Üí Actions: story analysis, plot validation, narrative consistency checking
   ‚Üí Data: story structures, plot threads, character arcs, genre patterns
   ‚Üí Constraints: must integrate with existing service architecture (story.ft.tc:8010)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All clarifications resolved - prioritize quality over speed, support 10 concurrent requests
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: Agent requests story analysis ‚Üí receives narrative intelligence
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities (story arcs, plot threads, narrative beats)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Focus on business value, avoid implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-26
- Q: How should the system respond when story analysis requests contain incomplete or malformed narrative content? ‚Üí A: Perform partial analysis with confidence scores and missing data warnings
- Q: What minimum confidence threshold should trigger genre analysis warnings or recommendations? ‚Üí A: 75% confidence threshold - balanced precision and coverage
- Q: How should the system ensure story analysis for different projects remains separate and doesn't leak narrative context between concurrent requests? ‚Üí A: Separate analysis processes launched per project
- Q: How long should story session data persist before automatic cleanup? ‚Üí A: Until project completion or manual deletion
- Q: When external services (Brain, Auto-Movie, Task services) are unavailable, how should the MCP Story Service respond? ‚Üí A: Fail immediately with integration error messages

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
AI agents working on movie production need specialized narrative intelligence to create consistent, well-structured stories. They send story content to the MCP Story Service and receive analysis, validation, and improvement suggestions to ensure their generated content follows proper storytelling conventions and maintains narrative consistency across episodes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an AI agent has a story outline, **When** it requests structure analysis, **Then** it receives three-act breakdown with genre-specific recommendations
2. **Given** a multi-episode story is being developed, **When** plot threads are submitted for tracking, **Then** the system identifies thread lifecycle status and resolution opportunities
3. **Given** existing story content with potential plot holes, **When** consistency validation is requested, **Then** the system identifies contradictions and provides severity ratings with suggested fixes
4. **Given** a story needs genre-specific improvements, **When** genre pattern analysis is requested, **Then** the system provides conventions compliance and authenticity recommendations

### Edge Cases
- **Incomplete/malformed content**: System performs partial analysis with confidence scores and missing data warnings
- How does the system handle conflicting genre conventions in hybrid stories?
- What occurs when plot thread resolution suggestions conflict with creative intent?
- How does the system manage story validation for extremely long narratives (100+ episodes)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST analyze story structures and identify three-act progression with genre-specific variations
- **FR-002**: System MUST track plot threads across multiple episodes and identify their lifecycle status (introduced, developing, ready for resolution, resolved)
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate narrative consistency by detecting plot holes, timeline contradictions, and character inconsistencies
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide genre-specific storytelling guidance for at least 15 different movie genres with 75% confidence threshold for recommendations
- **FR-005**: System MUST calculate story pacing and tension curves to identify pacing issues
- **FR-006**: System MUST integrate with existing AI movie platform services via MCP protocol at story.ft.tc:8010
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide real-time story validation during content generation processes
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain story state across multiple query sessions for project continuity until project completion or manual deletion
- **FR-009**: System MUST offer story improvement suggestions with actionable recommendations
- **FR-010**: System MUST support concurrent story analysis for multiple projects without cross-contamination using separate analysis processes per project

### Performance Requirements
- **PR-001**: System MUST prioritize quality over speed for story analysis, allowing sufficient time for thorough narrative intelligence
- **PR-002**: System MUST handle up to 10 simultaneous story analysis requests during current development phase

### Integration Requirements
- **IR-001**: System MUST communicate with AI agents through standardized MCP protocol interfaces
- **IR-002**: System MUST coordinate with Brain service (brain.ft.tc:8002) for cross-domain knowledge consistency or fail with integration error when unavailable
- **IR-003**: System MUST integrate with Auto-Movie dashboard (auto-movie.ft.tc:3010) for user story guidance or fail with integration error when unavailable
- **IR-004**: System MUST work with Task service (tasks.ft.tc:8001) to guide content generation with narrative context or fail with integration error when unavailable

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Story Arc**: Represents complete narrative structure with beginning/middle/end, genre classification, and pacing information
- **Plot Thread**: Individual story element with introduction point, development stages, and resolution requirements
- **Narrative Beat**: Specific story moment with emotional impact scoring and structural significance
- **Character Journey**: Character development progression aligned with plot advancement and story structure
- **Genre Template**: Reusable storytelling patterns specific to movie genres with convention rules and authenticity markers
- **Consistency Rule**: Validation logic for detecting narrative contradictions and maintaining story coherence
